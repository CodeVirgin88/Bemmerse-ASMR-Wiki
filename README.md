### What are vertical videos? Aspect Ratios
What is a vertical video? A simple answer would be "a video recorded vertically". And it truly can be that simple.
Though let's get a bit nerdy here. Vertical video is a video with an aspect ratio between 4:5 and 9:16 (or 16 to 18 as smartphones are getting taller).

We recommend the 9:16 aspect ratio.

### How?
Let's start with some basic settings checks to make sure it'll work. 

- Make sure that in your settings you have "auto-rotate" on. 
- Check the aspect ratio.
- Record vertically (phone or camera to 90Â°).
- In case the auto-rotate didn't work, you can just simply rotate it in any editor or video viewer on your phone or computer.
- Record in 4k and crop (not recommended).

- TIP: You can also put two frames on top of each other to offer different angle at a scene and even more immersion.
 
### Extra Tips:
- Tip: Get your subject (probably you) close to the camera. With vertical video you can create a feeling of more intimate experience which your followers love. 
- Fill the frame. 
- Don't move the camera.
